# Changesets

This directory is used by [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to manage versioning and changelogs.

When making changes to the `vs3` package, run `pnpm changeset` to create a new changeset describing your changes. The generated `.md` file should be committed alongside your code changes.
