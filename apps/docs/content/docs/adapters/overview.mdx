description: Understand the adapter contract and choose the right S3-compatible provider preset.
---

Adapters connect `vs3` to a storage provider by supplying a preconfigured `S3Client`.
All provider behavior in `vs3` is built on the same adapter contract, so changing providers is mostly a configuration change.

## Adapter Contract

An adapter is a small object with a single field:

```ts
type Adapter = {
  readonly client: S3Client;
};
```

You pass this adapter to `createStorage({ adapter })`.

## Basic Usage

```ts
import { createStorage } from "vs3";
import { aws } from "vs3/adapters";

const storage = createStorage({
  bucket: "my-bucket",
  adapter: aws({
    region: "us-east-1",
    credentials: {
      accessKeyId: process.env.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID!,
      secretAccessKey: process.env.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY!,
    },
  }),
});
```

    Adapter presets require `@aws-sdk/client-s3` and `@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner`.
