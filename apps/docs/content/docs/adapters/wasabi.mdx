description: Configure the wasabi adapter for Wasabi Hot Cloud Storage.
---

Use `wasabi` for Wasabi S3-compatible buckets.

## Basic Setup

```ts
import { wasabi } from "vs3/adapters";

const adapter = wasabi({
  region: "us-east-1",
  credentials: {
    accessKeyId: process.env.WASABI_ACCESS_KEY!,
    secretAccessKey: process.env.WASABI_SECRET_KEY!,
  },
});
```

## Options

```ts
{
  region: string; // e.g. "us-east-1", "eu-central-1", "ap-northeast-1"
  credentials: {
    accessKeyId: string;
    secretAccessKey: string;
  };
}
```

## Notes

- Endpoint is generated as `https://s3.<region>.wasabisys.com`.
- Keep region and bucket location aligned to avoid signing/endpoint mismatches.
