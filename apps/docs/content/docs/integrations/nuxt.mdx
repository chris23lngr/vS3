description: Integrate vS3 with Nuxt 3
---

`vS3` does not currently provide a dedicated Nuxt integration helper.
You can integrate it in Nuxt 3 by mounting `storage.handler` through `h3`'s `fromWebHandler`.

## Usage

```ts title="server/api/storage/[...all].ts"
import { fromWebHandler } from "h3";
import { storage } from "../../storage";

export default fromWebHandler(storage.handler);
```

This mounts the vS3 API at `/api/storage/**` in your Nuxt app.
If you use a custom `apiPath`, mount the route at the matching server path.
